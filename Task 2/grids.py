'''
Something to look into is plotting the performance of the solver against the 
number of zeros in the grid.  This is a good way to see how the solver performs
Its also a good was to see how different mods impact the performance of the solver
Currently, grid8 takes about 30 seconds to solve on my computer
'''
# print the number of zeros in the each grid
for grid in grids:
    zeros = sum([row.count(0) for row in grid[0]])
